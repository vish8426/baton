Control the movement of a turtlebot with your gestures!

## About
This repository encompasses the development of a mechatronic system demonstrating the dynamic control of a TurtleBot utilizing hand gesture recognition. 

This specfic system has been named Baton. The system can recognize hand signals and gestures through a RGB camera or webcam and read such information being transformed into comprehensible data for a TurtleBot. This data is processed and sent in real-time to the TurtleBot, allowing for control over its movement. 

Such control includes the manipulation of the TurtleBots movement in terms of velocity. The system employs the recognition of approximately seven gestures controlling movement of the TurtleBot:
1. forward
2. backward
3. acceleration
4. deceleration
5. left
6. right

## Context
The system has been named Baton originating from the idea of an orchestral conductors tool known as a Baton, utilized in controlling and guiding of an orchestra. Hence, comparable and summarising the key aspects of this system, employing hand signals and gestures to control the velocity and movement of a TurtleBot.
